                The letter from Inc.

                    acquired a new facility in January of 2009. The tenant finish 
                    was completed in April and is now up and running. Ducts has 
                    invested heavily in making the new facility as Green as possible. 
                    They have installed all new Carrier PV model roof top units. 
                    The Carrier PV units are the highest efficient and the only 
                    LEED certified units on the market. All of the existing forced 
                    air unit heaters have been removed and replaced with high efficiency 
                    radiant tube heaters for the fabrication shop. The exterior 
                    walls and roof have R-30 insulation to maximize the gas heat 
                    that is being used. All offices have motion detector light switches 
                    in order to minimize the use of lights. Finally, the plumbing 
                    is designed for low water consumption. With all of these features 
                    Ducts Unlimited hopes to operate in a more environmentally friendly 
                    way.                  </p>
                  <p>The new facility will allow Ducts to take a step forward 
                    in their ability to serve their customers. &quot;First of 
                    all we will be making the transition from printing blue prints 
                    for bid to estimating on screen&quot; says Rob, owner of Ducts 
                    Unlimited. &quot;We will only print the plans for the projects 
                    we are awarded and cut our paper consumption by 80%. Our second 
                    exciting change will be to make the transition from 4' ductwork 
                    to 5' ductwork. This step alone will allow us to produce more 
                    ductwork in less time and get the product to the field for 
                    installation sooner, helping us achieve the ultimate goal 
                    of completing the projects on time. We at Ducts Unlimited 
                    are committed to providing the highest quality product and 
                    service available.&quot;<br>
