                  <p>I wanted to thank you for your service department droping what you were doing to assist Carol and myself on executing the inspection of the South Park Building. I know you were very busy and that I can always count on you guys coming through for me.</p>
                  <p>It is my understanding that Carol and her client are very pleased with your performance and asked me to pass it along to you</p>

                  <p>I wanted to say that I will be requesting Matt for all my jobs with Ducts. I had Matt and Steve for the majority of the time on the RBC project and was extreemly happy with both of them. They both have a "can do attitude" and communicated great with each other and with me. They look ahead to what is coming up and deliver what they communicate. Ducts is lucky to have guys like this in the company. </p>

                  <p>Usually my emails are to ask for something or address a problem that the field can't solve. This email is to congratulate you on a job WELL DONE!</p>
                  <p>Joe was my onsite foreman. He handled himself with professionalism and a genuine concern for our project. We always try to have the best people on our projects, but Joe stands out as a true tradesman. When we had a problem in the ceiling (which we always do) Joe made competent suggestions that the Mechanical Engineer agreed with. The Building Engineer and Manager even noticed Joe's quality of work and mentioned his professionalism to me as well.</p>
                  <p>Just wanted to say thank you and great job!</p>

<p>Just a quick email about SNC. I wanted to say how great the install was at the SNC Hanger 13. Oso did a wonderfull job with the trunk lines, the flex, sealing the ducts. It was straight, clean and looked great. He was very responsive to questionsand always had an answer when asked.</p>
                  <p>Thanks</p>

                  <p>I wanted to let you know how much I appriciate the effort you and Oso put in on the CHI project. It was due to the hard work of both of you that helped us finish the project. We really think that Oso went above and beoynd at the end of the project to help get the final HVAC with the building department. Thanks for your help!</p>

Their performance on a complicated set of projects was exemplary and I would recommend them as an outstanding one two punch to our management team any day. They were able to overcome several challenges and were paramount to the success of my projects.</p>

                  <p>I wanted to shoot a quick email to address the expirience I had with your on call service tech this past weekend. I only know him as Paul but what a class act. His dinner out with his family was interrupted by us at 6:30 Saturday evening and not only did he react immediatly, but he did so with complete professionalism and courtesy. All I can saw is OUTSTANDING and know that he represented your company in a manner of which you should be very proud.</p>

                  <p>I wanted to let you know that both Fernando and Eric Garcia did an excillant job on the Suite 2540 project. We planned on having our inspection on Friday 2/17/2012 and due to the City of Denver having a furlow day we were forced to move up our inspection date. Eric and his helper were still able to make the earlier inspection and Fernando was able to provide additional man power to ensure that we passed our inspections. Ducts did a great job and the property management is extremely pleased as well. I look forward to working on future projects with Ducts Unlimited.</p>

                  <p>I do not believe that any firm working on the AIA Colorado project profited monetatily, (At least not those who volunteered their resources). However, recognition of a job well done is warranted where applicable, and I belive it is aplicable on this project.</p>
                  <p>Until now, I personally was not aware of your Ducts Unlimited existence. However, from here on out I will keep in mind as one to recommend should the opportunity present itself.</p>
                  <p>My compliments to your team.</p>

                  <p>Dear Rob,</p>
                  <p>In a recent job close out meeting we were told by Greg Gruno, our Superintendent, that your company and on-site crew preformed their job above and beyond expectations.</p>
                  <p>As you may or may not be aware, about 90% of our projects come through repeat clients and referrals. The only way we can maintain this ratio is by consistently delivering a superior product for each of our clients. You continue to be a valuable part of our team and your contributions allow Mendel &amp; Company to pursue our goal of "Building Relationships".</p>
                  <p>We would like to take this opportunity to say "Thank You" and let you know how much your company's work ethic and dedication are appreciated.</p>
                  <p>Sincerely,</p>
                  <p>Nathan Mendel.</p>

                  <p>I wanted to take a minute to advise you of the work efforts and hard work that Ducts Unlimited did for me on the WSMT project. Your lead guy Eric, was awesome at always checking with me from day to day on my needs and path of their install. As you know the Modulines came in on many different shipments. Once we had a lot here Fernando Gomez made sure he put more men on the project for Eric. They were able to do the install of the Modulines and all the piping along with the controls that has allowed me to knock off a week from our schedule</p>
                  <p>It is very clear we have Ducts Unlimited as a Team Player on our projects. Please Pass this on to Estimating and to all the other office managers</p>
                  <p>Congrats to Eric, &amp; Ferando and there field team for making this happen.</p>

We have not missed a beat and you have been on top of  every concern/change order. The 4th floor has been especially  difficult because of the starts and stops, but again you have accommodated Max  Construction and LBA Realty. Also I appreciate having Arturo as a foreman. He  has always been polite, he is thorough, and he makes sure that his job sites  are clean every night. Ducts Unlimited is the cleanest contractor that I have  right now and I can not remember the last time I had to ask them to clean up  after themselves. &nbsp;</p>
